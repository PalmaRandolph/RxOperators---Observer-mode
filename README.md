# RxOperators---Observer-mode

RxSwift is a combination of simplified asynchronous operations and event/data flow.
It contains many operators, for example: combineLatest. concat .merge.amb.skipwhile.interval....
This application shows the declaration of an operator in an asynchronous operation or sequence of events.
Users can freely change the order of the operators to combine multiple sequence methods.
